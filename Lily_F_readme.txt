To see the simulation of printer, run the Delta_simulator.scad in OpenScad
The parameters of this simulation are defined in data_HXM.scad
effector simulation use stl files created in Effector_HXM.scad 
The parameters of this simulation are defined in data_HXM.scad
To creates STL file, define a part Number in data_HXM.scad in OpenScad
To creates STL files for the effector, define a part Number in Effector_HXM.scad in OpenScad

The parts and instructions for Geared extruder is in the main directory 'Geared Extruder'
The parts and instructions for Spool support is in the main directory '3D printer spool on top'
